Case do you need an internet connection at beagleBone Black and the only form to do this is over a USB cable, you should run these scripts.

In your PC, run the netOverUsbPC.sh:
'''
	sudo ./netOverUsbPC.sh
'''

In the BeagleBone Black, run the netOverUsbBB.sh:
'''
	sudo ./netOverUsbBBB.sh
'''

NOTE: this should work at Debian, run these scripts at another OS must have some differences.
